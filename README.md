## Introduction

The **Inception 42** project is designed to create a fully containerized development environment using **Docker** and **Docker Compose**. This project provides a simple and scalable way to set up containers for a variety of services, such as databases, web servers, or other applications, all defined and managed with Docker and Docker Compose.

## Project Overview

This repository provides:

- A set of Dockerfiles to build the necessary containers.
- A **Docker Compose** configuration file to define and run multi-container applications.
- An easy way to deploy and manage a set of services without worrying about local environment setup.
- Reusable configurations for any Dockerized application, making it simple to scale or modify for specific needs.

## Technologies Used

- **Docker**: Containerization platform to run applications in isolated environments.
- **Docker Compose**: Tool to define and run multi-container Docker applications using a `docker-compose.yml` file.
